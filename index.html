                    <p>
                        Everyone should be able to set up their own route planner with their specific needs.
                        Before Planner.js, it used to be expensive to set up your own route planner:
                        you first need to find the right data dumps, need to integrate them manually into your own format,
                        and then you need to connect them to a route planning system.
                        The real-time data then should be handled with a different system if is available at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we want to create a level playing field, these steps should be automated.
                        Planner.js gives everyone the tools to start working with route planning data in no time.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Client-side execution of the route planning algorithms</h3>

                        Planner.js makes heavy use of <a href="http://inversify.io/">inversify</a>, a dependency injection framework.
                        This allows anyone to make a quick custom build of a route planner, with specific needs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Different Interfaces</h3>
                    <p>
                        For a full overview, please consult our <a href="code">code documentation</a>.
                        The interfaces for the Planner are split in:
                    </p>
                    <h4>Fetchers</h4>
                    <p>
                        These are ways to fetch data from different sources.
                        We will use the Comunica framework to fetch the data as an intelligent agent.
                        For now, we are just using the Linked Data Fetch NPM package and manually implement the routable tiles and Linked Connections specification.
                    </p>   
                    <h4>Planners</h4>
                    <p>There are road, public-transport and inter-stop distance planners.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Creating your own Planner version</h3>
                    <p>
                        <i>We still need to properly write this part of the documentation.</i>
                        However, the code may  help you out understanding how it currently works.
                        By default, the file inversify.config.ts is going to be used to build the Planner.
                        The Planner instance must be instantiated with the dependencies container.
                        If you bundle a different dependencies container with your Planner,
                        your specific Planner will be able to act differently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        E.g., one could make a dependency container specifically for shared bikes and public transport.
                        Therefore, we would need to bind different classes to the Planner: //TODO
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another example would be to create a dependency container for public transport systems only.
                        In this case, we would change the RoadPlanner to just using RoadPlannerBirdsEye, in order to understand where we can transfer.
